# Unit 3: SQL Fundamentals and Database Operations – From Confusion to Clarity! 🎢📊
  
This week, I dove into **Unit 3: Database Systems**, and wow, my brain is buzzing with SQL queries and ACID properties! Let me walk you through what I learned, how my understanding evolved, and some fun experiments I did. Buckle up! 🚀

## **My Pre-Unit Brain vs. Post-Unit Brain 🧠💥**

Before this unit, my idea of databases was: *"Uh, it’s where apps store data?"* 🤷♂️  
Now? I can confidently say databases are **structured**, **transaction-safe**, and powered by **SQL magic**. Here’s how it all unfolded:

---

## **ACID Properties: The Pillars of Reliability 💎**

I learned that databases aren’t just about storing data—they need to be **reliable**. Enter **ACID**:  
- **Atomicity**: Transactions are all-or-nothing. Think of transferring money: if one step fails, everything rolls back. 💸➡️💸❌  
- **Consistency**: The database stays valid *before* and *after* transactions. No half-baked data! 🍳✅  
- **Isolation**: Multiple transactions don’t interfere. Like separate checkout lanes at a supermarket. 🛒🚶♂️🚶♀️  
- **Durability**: Once committed, data stays safe even if the system crashes. 💾🛡️  

*Mind-blowing moment*: Realizing ACID is why banking apps don’t randomly lose my transactions. 🤯

## **SQL: My New Superpower 🦸♂️**

SQL went from *"scary code"* to *"my data BFF"*. Here’s what I practiced:

### **1. Creating Tables 🏗️**  
I designed an **Airline Ticketing Database** (fancy, right?). Here’s a snippet:  
```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    Username VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    DOB DATE,
    F_Name VARCHAR(255)
);
```
*Fun fact*: `User` is a reserved keyword—I learned that the hard way! 😅

### **2. Constraints = Rules for Data Police 🚨**
- `PRIMARY KEY`: Unique IDs for every row.

- `FOREIGN KEY`: Linking tables like Flight ⇨ Users.

- `CHECK`: Ensuring values make sense (e.g., `Age > 0`).

## **Querying Like a Pro 🔍**
### **Basic Queries**
- `SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Gender = 'Male';` ➡️ Filters data effortlessly.

`JOINed` tables to link tickets with users. Felt like solving a puzzle! 🧩

### **Advanced Tricks**

- **Aggregate Functions**: Calculated average fares with `AVG().`

- **Nested Subqueries**: Used `IN` to find flights booked by specific users.

```sql
SELECT Flight_no 
FROM Ticket 
WHERE Booked_by_user IN (SELECT Username FROM Users WHERE Gender = 'Female');
```
---

## **Null Values: The Silent Chaos 😶🌫️**
Handling `NULL` was tricky! Did you know:

`NULL + 5 = NULL?` Math breaks!

`WHERE column IS NULL` is your friend.

*Lesson*: Always design tables to minimize `NULL` unless necessary!

---

## **The Joy (and Pain) of Modifying Data 🛠️**
- **Inserted** fake users and flights (shoutout to "John Doe" ✈️).

- **Deleted** test data with `DELETE FROM Users WHERE Username = 'user1';`

- **Dropped** tables accidentally. Thank goodness for backups! 😇

## **Final Thoughts 💭**
Databases are like intricate LEGO sets: every piece (table, query, constraint) fits together to build something powerful. Few weeks ago, I’d panic at `SELECT *`; now, I’m writing multi-table joins! 🎉

*Pro tip*: Practice on real-world projects (like my airline system) to cement concepts. And never fear the semicolon `;`!

Catch you in the next unit! 👋
