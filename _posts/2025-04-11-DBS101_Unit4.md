# Unit 4: Advanced SQL and Database Programming

## What I Thought Before ðŸ¤”
Before starting Unit 4, I knew basic SQL commands like  `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `JOIN`, but I had no idea how deep SQL could go. I thought SQL was just for querying data, not for programming logic or enforcing complex rules. Terms like "triggers," "recursive queries," and "materialized views" sounded intimidating. I assumed writing stored procedures or handling transactions required another programming language. 

---

## What I Learned in Unit 4 ðŸ“š
### 1. Advanced Joins and Views
**Natural Join vs. Inner Join**

I learned that **natural joins** automatically match columns with the same name, while **inner joins** require explicit `ON` conditions.

**Example:**
```sql
-- Natural Join (implicit matching)
SELECT * FROM Orders NATURAL JOIN Customers;

-- Inner Join (explicit condition)
SELECT * FROM Orders 
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
```

**Outer Joins**

Outer joins preserve unmatched rows:

- **LEFT JOIN:** Includes all left table rows.

- **RIGHT JOIN:** Includes all right table rows.

- **FULL OUTER JOIN:** Includes all rows from both tables.

**Views and Materialized Views**

- **Views:** Virtual tables created by queries. They donâ€™t store data but simplify complex queries.

```sql
CREATE VIEW swe_faculty AS
SELECT ID, name FROM instructor WHERE deptname = 'SWE';
```

- **Materialized Views:** Physically store query results and auto-update when base tables change. Useful for speeding up frequent queries.

### 2. Transactions and Integrity Constraints
**ACID Properties**

Transactions ensure **Atomicity**, **Consistency**, **Isolation**, and **Durability**.

**Example:**

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE user = 'Alice';
UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE user = 'Bob';
COMMIT;
```
**Constraints**

- **Primary Key:** Uniquely identifies rows.

- **Foreign Key:** Links tables.

- **Check Constraints:** Validate data (e.g., `age >= 18`).

- **Default Values:** Auto-fill columns if not specified.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Student (
  ID VARCHAR(5) PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  credits NUMERIC(3,0) DEFAULT 0
);
```

### 3. Indexes
Indexes speed up queries but slow down writes. Use them wisely.

```sql
CREATE INDEX dept_index ON instructor(deptname);  -- Non-unique index
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX unique_dept ON department(deptname);  -- Unique index\
```
**When to use:** Columns frequently used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, or `ORDER BY`.

---

### 4. SQL Authorization

![Authorization](/assets/unit4/authorization.webp)

**Privileges**

- `GRANT` and `REVOKE` control access.

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON Students TO user123;
REVOKE DELETE ON Grades FROM user123;
```

**Roles**

Group privileges for easier management:

```sql
CREATE ROLE Faculty;
GRANT SELECT ON Courses TO Faculty;
GRANT Faculty TO user456;
```
---

### 5. Accessing SQL from Programming Languages
**JDBC (Java)**

Connect Java apps to databases:

```java
Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:postgresql://localhost/mydb", "user", "pass");
Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM Students");
```

**ODBC (Python/C++)**

Universal database connectivity:


```python
import pyodbc
conn = pyodbc.connect("DRIVER={PostgreSQL};SERVER=localhost;DATABASE=mydb;UID=user;PWD=pass")
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM Students")
```
---

### 6. Functions and Procedures
**Functions**

Return a value and can be used in `SELECT` statements.

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION get_patient_appointments(patient_id INT) 
RETURNS TABLE (app_date DATE, purpose TEXT) AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY 
  SELECT AppointmentDate, Purpose FROM Appointment 
  WHERE PatientID = patient_id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**Procedures**

Perform actions without returning values (e.g., inserting data).

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE schedule_appointment(
  patient_id INT, 
  doctor_id INT, 
  app_date DATE
) LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO Appointment VALUES (patient_id, doctor_id, app_date);
END;
$$;
```
---

### 7. Triggers
Automatically execute code on database events (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).

![Triggers](/assets/unit4/triggers.png)

**Example:** Log changes to a table.

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER log_prescription 
AFTER INSERT ON Prescription
FOR EACH ROW 
EXECUTE FUNCTION notify_new_prescription();

-- Trigger function
CREATE FUNCTION notify_new_prescription() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  RAISE NOTICE 'New prescription: %', NEW.MedicationName;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```
---

### 8. Recursive Queries
**Use Case:** Hierarchical data (e.g., organizational charts).

![Recursion](/assets/unit4/recursion.jpg)

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE Subordinates AS (
  SELECT employee_id, name FROM Employees WHERE manager_id IS NULL
  UNION ALL
  SELECT e.employee_id, e.name FROM Employees e
  INNER JOIN Subordinates s ON e.manager_id = s.employee_id
)
SELECT * FROM Subordinates;
```
---

### 9. Advanced Aggregation
Use `ROLLUP`, `CUBE`, and `GROUPING SETS` for multi-level summaries.

```sql
SELECT deptname, COUNT(*) 
FROM Instructor 
GROUP BY ROLLUP(deptname);  -- Adds a grand total row
```
---

## How My Understanding Changed ðŸ§ 
I used to think SQL was just for simple queries, but now I see itâ€™s a powerful tool for:

- **Enforcing business rules** with triggers and constraints.

- **Automating workflows** with stored procedures.

- **Handling complex data** via recursive queries and materialized views.

- **Securing data** with roles and privileges.

Learning to write functions and triggers made me realize SQL can handle logic I thought required Python or Java. Recursive queries blew my mindâ€”they turn messy hierarchical data into clean results.

---

## Conclusion ðŸŽ‰
Unit 4 transformed me from an SQL novice to someone who can design robust, efficient, and secure databases. Iâ€™m excited to use triggers for auditing, optimize queries with indexes, and explore recursive data like organizational trees. Next step: building a full-stack app with PostgreSQL and Python.
