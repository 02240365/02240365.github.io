# Unit 6: Database Performance ‚Äì Indexing, Query Processing, and Optimization

## What I Thought Before ü§î
I used to think databases magically fetched data instantly. "Why worry about indexes? Just write the SQL." I assumed query optimization was the database's job, not mine. Terms like "B+ trees" and "pipelining" sounded like engineering jargon irrelevant to writing queries. My mantra: "If it runs, ship it."

## What I Learned in Unit 6 üìö  

### 1. **Indexing: The Database‚Äôs Secret Weapon**  
Indexes are like a book‚Äôs index - they help the database find data without scanning every page (or row).  

#### **Types of Indices**  
- **Ordered Indices**: Sorted keys (e.g., `CREATE INDEX ON employees (salary)`).  
  - *Clustering*: Data is physically sorted (e.g., primary key).  
  - *Non-clustering*: Separate index structure (slower for range queries).  
- **Hashed Indices**: Buckets based on hash values (blazing fast for exact matches).  

**Example**:  
```sql
-- Dense index (every key has an entry)
CREATE INDEX employees_idx ON employees (emp_id);

-- Sparse index (keys sampled per block)
CREATE INDEX employees_sparse_idx ON employees (salary) WITH (fillfactor=100);
```
**Why?** Without indexes, searching for `emp_id = 123` requires a full table scan - like finding a word in a book by reading every page.

#### B+ Trees: The Gold Standard
- **Structure**: Balanced tree with sorted keys in nodes and data only in leaves.
- **Why?** Efficient for range queries (`salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 80000`) and maintains balance during inserts/deletes.

Searching for k=45 in a B+ tree involves traversing from the root to the leaf.

### 2. Query Processing: From SQL to Results
Databases don‚Äôt execute SQL directly - they transform it into an execution plan.

#### Three Key Steps
- **1. Parsing & Translation**: SQL ‚Üí Relational Algebra (e.g., `SELECT * FROM employees` ‚Üí `œÉ(employees)`).
- **2. Optimization**: Picks the cheapest plan using cost estimates.
- **3. Execution**: Runs the plan (e.g., uses an index if cheaper than scanning).

**Example Plan:**
```sql
œÄ name (œÉ salary>75000 (instructor))  
```
Project names of instructors earning >75,000, using an index on salary.

#### Pipelining vs. Materialization
- **Pipelining**: Streams data between operations (like an assembly line).
- **Materialization**: Stores intermediate results (slower but simpler).

---

### 3. Query Optimization: The Art of Being Lazy
Optimizers avoid unnecessary work by rewriting queries and picking efficient algorithms.

#### Equivalence Rules
- **Push Down Selections**: Filter early to reduce data.

```sql
-- Original: œÉ dept='CS' (instructor ‚®ù teaches)
-- Optimized: œÉ dept='CS' (instructor) ‚®ù teaches
```

- **Join Ordering**: Smaller tables first.
    - Bad: `large_table ‚®ù tiny_table` (scans millions of rows).

    - Good: `tiny_table ‚®ù large_table` (uses indexes).

#### Cost Estimation
- **Metrics**: Disk I/O, CPU time, memory.

- **Example**: For a join:

    - *Nested-loop*: Cost = `br * bs + br` (br = blocks in R).

    - *Hash join*: Cost = `3(br + bs)` (but needs memory).

**Real-World Tip**: Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` in PostgreSQL to see the chosen plan.

---

### 4. Advanced Techniques
- **Multilevel Indexes**: Indexes on indexes! Useful when the main index doesn‚Äôt fit in memory.

- **Hash Indices**: Great for exact matches but fail at ranges.

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON users USING hash (id);  -- Fast for `WHERE id = 123`
```

- **Temporal Data:** Track changes over time with valid_from/valid_to columns.

---

## How My Understanding Has Changed ü§Ø
I now see indexes as essential, not optional. A missing index can turn a 10ms query into a 10s nightmare. Query optimization isn‚Äôt magic - it‚Äôs a systematic process of rewriting and cost comparison.

The biggest revelation? **Join ordering matters**. A bad order can explode intermediate results (like joining a 1M-row table before filtering it down to 10 rows).

## Conclusion
Unit 6 taught me that database performance hinges on smart indexing and query planning. Writing SQL is like giving directions - the clearer and more efficient, the faster you arrive.

**Key takeaway**: Always EXPLAIN your queries. What you think is happening isn‚Äôt always what the database does.
