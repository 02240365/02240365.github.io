# Unit 7: Database Transactions, Concurrency Control, and Recovery Systems

## What I Thought Before ü§î

I naively assumed databases just "handled" multiple users automatically. "Concurrent access? The database figures it out." I thought transactions were just a fancy way to group SQL statements, and recovery was simply restoring from backups. Terms like "two-phase locking," "deadlocks," and "ARIES algorithm" seemed like theoretical concepts with little practical relevance. My approach: "Write the code, let the database worry about the rest."

## What I Learned in Unit 7 üìö

### 1. **Database Transactions: The ACID Foundation**

A transaction is a collection of operations forming a single logical unit of work. The magic lies in the **ACID properties**:

#### **ACID Properties Explained**

- **Atomicity**: All or nothing execution
- **Consistency**: Database remains in valid state
- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions don't interfere
- **Durability**: Committed changes persist despite failures


**Example Transaction**:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 50 WHERE account_name = 'A';
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 50 WHERE account_name = 'B';
COMMIT;
```

**Why ACID Matters**: Without atomicity, a system crash between the two updates could leave account A debited but account B never credited - money vanishes into thin air.

#### **Transaction States**

Transactions progress through five states:

- **Active**: Currently executing
- **Partially Committed**: Final statement executed, awaiting commit
- **Failed**: Cannot proceed normally
- **Aborted**: Rolled back to pre-transaction state
- **Committed**: Successfully completed and durable


---

### 2. **Concurrency Control: Managing the Chaos**

When multiple transactions execute simultaneously, isolation becomes challenging. The solution? **Concurrency control schemes**.

#### **Locking Mechanisms**

Two primary lock types ensure data integrity:

- **Shared (S) Locks**: Multiple transactions can read, none can write
- **Exclusive (X) Locks**: Single transaction has read/write access


**Lock Compatibility Matrix**:

```plaintext
        S    X
    S   ‚úì    ‚úó
    X   ‚úó    ‚úó
```

#### **Two-Phase Locking (2PL)**

The gold standard for ensuring serializability:

1. **Growing Phase**: Acquire locks, never release
2. **Shrinking Phase**: Release locks, never acquire


**Example**:

```sql
-- Growing phase
LOCK TABLE accounts IN EXCLUSIVE MODE;
-- Perform operations
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
-- Shrinking phase
COMMIT; -- Releases all locks
```

#### **Deadlock: The Inevitable Problem**

When transactions wait for each other in a cycle:

- **T1** waits for lock held by **T2**
- **T2** waits for lock held by **T1**
- Result: Neither can proceed


**Solutions**:

- **Detection**: Build wait-for graphs, detect cycles
- **Prevention**: Use timestamps (Wait-Die, Wound-Wait schemes)


---

### 3. **Advanced Concurrency: Beyond Basic Locking**

#### **Timestamp Ordering**

Assign timestamps to transactions; older transactions get priority:

```plaintext
If TS(Ti) < TS(Tj), then Ti must appear before Tj in execution
```

#### **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)**

Maintain multiple versions of data items:

- **Writers don't block readers**
- **Readers don't block writers**
- Each transaction sees a consistent snapshot


**Snapshot Isolation**: Transactions see database state as it existed when they started. However, this can lead to **write skew anomalies** where two transactions make disjoint updates based on overlapping reads.

---

### 4. **Recovery Systems: Ensuring Durability**

System failures are inevitable. Recovery systems ensure committed transactions survive crashes.

#### **Log-Based Recovery**

Every database modification is logged before execution:

**Log Record Format**: `<Ti, Xj, V1, V2>`

- Ti: Transaction identifier
- Xj: Data item
- V1: Old value
- V2: New value


#### **Recovery Operations**

- **Undo**: Restore old values for aborted transactions
- **Redo**: Reapply new values for committed transactions


#### **ARIES Algorithm**

The industry-standard recovery algorithm with three phases:

1. **Analysis**: Determine which transactions to undo/redo
2. **Redo**: Repeat history to restore pre-crash state
3. **Undo**: Rollback incomplete transactions


**Key Principles**:

- **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**: Log before database changes
- **Repeating History**: Restore exact pre-crash state
- **Logging During Undo**: Record undo actions for crash recovery


#### **Checkpoints: Limiting Recovery Work**

Periodically save database state to stable storage:

- Reduces log scanning during recovery
- Enables log truncation
- **Fuzzy checkpoints** allow continued transaction processing


---

### 5. **Storage Architecture and Recovery**

Understanding storage hierarchy is crucial for recovery:

- **Volatile Storage**: Main memory (lost on crash)
- **Non-volatile Storage**: Disk storage (survives crashes)
- **Stable Storage**: Replicated across multiple devices (theoretical ideal)


**Buffer Management Policies**:

- **No-Force**: Don't write dirty pages at commit
- **Steal**: Allow writing uncommitted changes to disk


---

## How My Understanding Has Changed ü§Ø

I now realize that database concurrency and recovery are incredibly sophisticated. What seemed like "automatic" behavior is actually the result of complex algorithms managing locks, timestamps, and logs.

The biggest revelation? **Serializability vs. Performance trade-offs**. Strict serializability ensures correctness but limits concurrency. Real systems often use weaker isolation levels (like snapshot isolation) for better performance, accepting certain anomalies.

**Key insight**: The choice between pessimistic (locking) and optimistic (validation-based) concurrency control depends on workload characteristics - high contention favors pessimistic, low contention favors optimistic.

## Practical Applications üí°

#### **Lock Granularity Hierarchy**

```sql
-- Table-level lock (coarse granularity)
LOCK TABLE employees IN EXCLUSIVE MODE;

-- Row-level lock (fine granularity)  
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = 123 FOR UPDATE;
```

#### **Intention Locks**

Enable efficient hierarchical locking:

- **IS (Intention Shared)**: Intent to acquire S locks at lower level
- **IX (Intention Exclusive)**: Intent to acquire X locks at lower level
- **SIX (Shared + Intention Exclusive)**: S lock on subtree + IX intent


---

## Real-World Implications üåç

Modern databases implement sophisticated variations:

- **PostgreSQL**: Uses MVCC with snapshot isolation
- **MySQL InnoDB**: Supports multiple isolation levels
- **Oracle**: Pioneered read consistency through MVCC


**Performance Considerations**:

- Lock escalation reduces overhead but decreases concurrency
- Deadlock detection frequency affects system responsiveness
- Recovery time depends on checkpoint frequency and log size


---

## Conclusion

Unit 7 revealed that database reliability isn't magic - it's engineering. ACID properties provide the foundation, but implementing them efficiently requires careful balance between correctness and performance.

**Key Takeaway**: Understanding concurrency control and recovery is essential for building robust database applications. The choice of isolation level and recovery strategy significantly impacts both correctness and performance.
