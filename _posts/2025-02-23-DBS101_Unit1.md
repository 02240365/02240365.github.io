# Unit 1: Database Systems Fundamentals

**What I Thought Before 🤔**

Before learning this database concept, my knowledge of databases was limited. I had heard terms like SQL, DBMS, and relational databases, but they were just a keywords to me. I thought databases were all about storing data in tables, and that was it.

I didn’t understand the importance of things like data consistency, security, or scalability. I also didn’t realize how databases were used in real-world applications like banking, social media, or even navigation systems.

## What I Learned in Unit 1 📚

**What is a Database System?**

A database is an organized collection of structured information, stored electronically.

A Database Management System (DBMS) is the software that helps us create, manage, and interact with databases.

Together, they form a Database System, which is way more powerful than I ever thought.

**Why Do We Need Database Systems?**

I learned that traditional file-based systems (like storing data in Excel sheets) have major drawbacks, such as data redundancy,inconsistency, and difficulty in accessing data.

Database systems solve these problems by ensuring data consistency, scalability, better security, and data abstraction. 

**Applications of Database Systems**

Databases are used everywhere. From banking (to manage transactions) to social media (to store user data) and even navigation systems (to map routes). I had no idea how important databases were to so many industries and everyone in general.

**Evolution of Database Systems**

I learned about the history of databases, from early file-based systems to modern relational databases.
The relational model, introduced by Edgar F. Codd in the 1960s, was a huge breakthrough. It separated the logical and physical layers of data storage, making databases more flexible and powerful.

**Data Models**

I was introduced to different types of data models, like the Entity-Relationship Model, Semi-structured Data Model,Object-Based Data Model, and Relational Model.
The Relational Model is the most widely used, where data is stored in tables, and SQL is used to manipulate the data.

![Object-Based Data Model](/assets/lib/unit1/objectoriented.png)

![Relational Model](/assets/lib/unit1/relational.png)

**Database Design**

I learned about the three levels of database design: conceptual,logical, and physical.
The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a key tool for designing databases. It helps visualize the relationships between different entities, like students, classes, and schools.

**Database Languages**

I now understand the difference between Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML).
SQL is the language used to interact with relational databases, and it’s way more important than I thought.

**Database Architecture**

I learned about two-tier and three-tier architectures, which are used to structure how applications interact with databases.

**Database Users and Administrators**

As someone who just learned about database users and administrators, I now understand that these roles are both important but has different purposes. Database users, like me, interact with the database to perform tasks like searching for information or updating records, usually with limited access. 

On the other hand, database administrators (DBAs) are like the caretakers of the system - they ensure everything runs smoothly, manage security, and handle backups and maintenance. While users focus on their specific tasks, administrators make sure the database is reliable and secure for everyone. It’s interesting to see how both roles work together to keep the database functional and efficient.

## How My Understanding Has Changed 🤓

After learning all of these database concepts, I see them as complex, highly organized systems that are essential for managing large amount of data efficiently. I now understand the importance of data consistency, security, and scalability, and how database systems are designed to handle these challenges.

I also have a newfound appreciation for data models and database design. The concept of data abstraction was entirely new to me, and I now understand how it allows developers to hide the complexity of data structures from end-users.

**Conclusion**

Completing Unit 1 has given me a solid foundation in database systems. I now understand the importance of databases in various systems and how they are designed to manage data efficiently. I’m excited to continue learning more about database design, relational modeling, and SQL in the upcoming units.
